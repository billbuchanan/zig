# Zig and Wolfssl

Demo applications are [here](https://asecuritysite.com/zig).

* Hashing with Zig and WolfSSL [here](src) Zig is a relatively new programming language and which is simple to use. In this case, we will use the crypto library to integrate with the hashing methods of SHA-1, SHA-2 (SHA-224, SHA-256) , and SHA-3 (SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384 and SHA3-512). We will integrate Zig with WolfSSL, and use the libwolfssl.a library.
